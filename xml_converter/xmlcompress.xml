        <description>Don't ask for sprinkles, don't ask for cream filled and for goodness sakes, don't forget to eat as many as you can in the summer because Britt's is only open during the tourist season. It is all perspective, but eating a hot, delicious, handmade donut at Britt's is one of those experiences that doesn't need any embellishments. Started by the Britts and Wrights in 1939, the donut shop has long been the cornerstone of the Boardwalk area. The process of making the donuts is a time honored, tightly guarded secret- so stop in for this deliciously nostalgic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;**Only open in Season (Weekends in April  and  Labor Day), cash only**&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>It all started at a famous surf break off the free road just north of Ensenada, Mexico. A group of friends, a small shanty on the cliffs and the best fish tacos ever tasted during many travels south. The experience of those flavors embodied the essence of Baja-fresh, savory and delicious. Since 1993, K-38 has been offering those flavors to you, using chilies and spices from all over the Southwest and Mexico- prepared with care and a taste for adventure.

Located behind the iron gate, just steps away from both the excitement of North Front Street and the beautiful views of the Riverwalk.  Late afternoon and early evening is time for quiet conversation- but weekend evenings brings music and dancing.</description>

        <description>Tour North Carolina and #x92;s oldest rural cemetery. The eloquent epitaphs and symbolic funerary art tell stories of those who lie beneath, and bring them to life for the living. The graves represent veterans from all wars and all branches of service, politicians, artists, architects, writers, developers, merchants, planters, fraternal order members, exporters, immigrants, victims of Yellow Fever epidemics, wives, mothers, infants and children, and a female Confederate spy. The information area at the main gate has copies of a self-guided walking tour of the Cemetery's areas of interest.</description>

        <description>These boat rentals allow you to captain your own power boat for a day, half day or a week-- or you can even rent the boat captain as well. Cruise the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), find a private beach, fish the ICW, or Carolina Beach and explore the Cape Fear River. You can also add the fun of a tube, water skis, knee-board or a wake-board. Located at Carolina Beach State Park Marina and Seapath Yacht Club in Wrightsville Beach just over the drawbridge from Wilmington.</description>

        <description>Born from the dreams of a little girl who loved both the beach and her grandmother's attic, she was later joined by her parents in 1994 when they opened the doors to Airlie Moon. Combining an appreciation of vintage finds and pieces that have a story, the Airlie Moon style was born and continues to this day. This lovely boutique offers fine linens, hand crafted jewelry, fresh and clean scented candles and soaps. Perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Airlie Moon finds inspiration in the natural beauty of the coast and translates that to objects and accessories to fill your home!</description>

This cozy Latin-American restaurant houses a bar made of reclaimed wood straight from Panama, deli counter for easy ordering, and charming outside courtyard. They are named for a dish made with a unique cooking style of chopped fish in acidic juices that "cook" the meat rather than using a hot pan. Can't decide which Ceviche dish to order? Try the El Quatro ceviche sampler with four types. This fun restaurant was featured in Season 28 of Guy Fiori and #x92;s television show &lt;em&gt;Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives&lt;/em&gt;.

        <description>Not your standard coffee shop, Lucky Joe Coffee brews their coffee in small batches-- low and slow, taking extra time without extracting the bitter, leaving an almost sweet, very rich and deep coffee flavor.  The coffee is kegged, pushed to the tap with nitrogen, and offered hot or cold in house or espresso strength. Looking for traditional coffee or chai? Lucky Joe offers that as well with a cutting edge bean to cup French press machine.  Also available are crushed fruit smoothies, locally baked pastries and a rotating menu of craft draft and bottled beer.  Join them for special events like the Fresh Brewed Comedy Hour</description>

        <description>Located directly across the street from the Brooklyn Arts Center on North Fourth Street in Historic Wilmington, this dog friendly brewery carries the name of an infamous pirate better known as Blackbeard.  The pirate theme carries throughout the 100 year old former firehouse with the first floor bar shaped like a ship and upstairs level resembling a tall ship's rigging.  Enjoy seasonal selections as well as their flagship brew: Teaches Peaches (Peach Wheat).  To find them, look for Blackbeard's flag on the front of the building.</description>

        <description>Serving award-winning burgers since 1962, you always have your choice of spicy Cajun fries, cinnamon and brown sugar dusted sweet potato fries with honey dipping sauce, or onion rings. One ground chuck burger was recently featured on the Cooking Channel's &lt;em&gt;Best thing I Ever Ate&lt;/em&gt;  the "Trailer Park Burger"  topped with a fried green tomato, house made jalapeno-pimento cheese,  and #x93;bread and butter and #x94; pickles, hickory smoked bacon, lettuce, onion and Winnie and #x92;s special chipotle sauce. Dine inside or walk to the fenced-in backyard and enjoy your meal on a picnic table under an umbrella. The original Winnie thought sodas and beer tasted better served in a chilled can, so her granddaughter proudly continues this tradition.</description>

        <description>This international twist on traditional Mexican lunch and dinner cuisine is served in a sophisticated casual environment centrally located between Historic Downtown, Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach.  Your unique dining experience starts with bread and dipping sauces (even though chips and salsa are on the menu).  All the sauces are fresh-made daily, and the cocktails crafted with fresh juices instead of mixes.  Choose from lots of healthy options including grilled entrees.  Must try specialties: Seafood or Tropical Ceviche and a Carajillo Cocktail made tableside (mix of Cuarenta y Tres, citrus/vanilla liquor, and espresso).</description>

        <description>Discover delicious dining in the heart of historic downtown at Seabird, a seafood restaurant and oyster bar devoted to North Carolina's coastal bounty. Dean Neff, a James Beard Foundation semifinalist for "Best Chef Southeast" and his wife, award-winning pastry chef, Lydia Clopton, have created a comfortable and stylish setting for dining all day from breakfast, lunch and brunch to dinner and late-night handcrafted cocktails. While seafood is the star of the show, vegans and carnivores will recognize the same thoughtful attention for ingredients and preparation. And you must save room for Lydia's desserts or drop by in the morning for whatever she is inspired to bake such as coffee cake, fruit crostadas and made-to-order biscuits with Dean's fried chicken and pimento cheese, cured fish, or Lydia's famous Strawberry-Rose Jam.</description>
